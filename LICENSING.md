## Architecture Usage Scope

After completing the One Pizza License (OPL) payment:

### Free Use (Internal / Own Use)

- The architecture is **free to use, modify, extend, and evolve** for the licensee’s own use.
- This includes:
  - personal projects
  - research
  - internal company systems
  - experimental or production deployments
- Further development and adaptation of the architecture for internal use is **explicitly encouraged**.

No additional permission is required for internal use once the OPL payment has been made.

---

### Commercial Solutions Built on the Architecture

If the licensee intends to:

- sell,
- license,
- or commercially distribute

a **solution, product, or service** whose **core value proposition is based on this architecture**,  
then **separate licensing terms must be agreed upon** with the original author.

This applies to:
- SaaS products
- commercial frameworks
- packaged agent systems
- resold AI platforms where the architecture itself is a selling point

---

### Summary (Plain English)

- After paying one pizza:
  - You can use the architecture freely for yourself or inside your organization.
  - You can modify and improve it as much as you want.
- If you want to **sell the architecture as a product or part of a product**,  
  licensing must be discussed separately.

The goal is:
- free internal innovation
- fair commercial attribution
- no silent reselling of the architecture itself


## 3) Moltbot compatibility note

If used inside autonomous agents:
- store only symbols and canonical semantics
- resolve meaning via JIT activation
- do not persist interpretations
- validate license via Cronos txid

🍕 One Pizza License — simple, fair, and explicit.
