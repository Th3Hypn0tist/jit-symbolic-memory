# LICENSING

This repository contains an **MVP implementation** of a separately defined architecture.

Please read carefully: different things are licensed differently.

---

## 1. Architecture Definition (Upstream)

The canonical definition of the architecture is published here:

https://github.com/Th3Hypn0tist/random/blob/main/LLM-symbolic-memory.md

That document defines the **JIT Symbolic Memory Architecture** itself.

This repository does **not** redefine the architecture.  
It only provides an **MVP implementation** of it.

---

## 2. Scope of This Repository

This repository contains:
- an MVP implementation
- reference tooling and examples
- documentation specific to this MVP

The architecture definition itself lives **upstream** and is referenced, not duplicated.

---

## 3. Document License (This Repository)

### Attribution-Only, No-Derivatives (A-ND)

Copyright © 2026  
Author: Aki Hirvilammi

This license applies **only to the written documents and code in this repository**.

You may:
- read, reference, and cite this repository
- fork it
- modify the code
- build upon the MVP implementation

You must:
- retain attribution to the original author
- retain reference to the upstream architecture definition

---

## 4. Architecture Use License — One Pizza License (OPL)

Use of the **JIT Symbolic Memory Architecture** (as defined upstream) requires acceptance of the **One Pizza License (OPL)**.

### License Fee

- One-time fee
- **One (1) pizza per end user**
- Pizza price is defined as the average pizza price in the user’s or company’s country
- No recurring payments

### Payment Method (Current)

- Network: **Cronos (EVM)**
- Token: any Cronos-supported coin or token
- Payment address:

0xAddc61aF05ACc594623c3e73D242C17d169A28b2

### Proof of License

- A confirmed on-chain transaction hash (txid) is sufficient proof
- No registration or manual verification is required

---

## 5. Internal Use and Further Development

After paying the One Pizza License:

- The architecture may be freely used for **personal, research, or internal organizational use**
- Further development, modification, and experimentation is **explicitly encouraged**
- This applies to:
  - this MVP
  - forks of this repository
  - independently developed implementations
  - open-source projects

The One Pizza License applies to **all internal use**, including future iterations and improvements.

---

## 6. Publishing Your Own Implementation

You may publish your own implementation (open source or otherwise) of this architecture, provided that:

1. You include a clear reference to the original architecture definition:
   https://github.com/Th3Hypn0tist/random/blob/main/LLM-symbolic-memory.md

2. You clearly state that:
   > Use of this architecture requires acceptance of the One Pizza License (OPL).

This ensures that:
- open-source development is fully allowed
- end users are clearly informed of the licensing requirement
- the architecture lineage remains visible

---

## 7. Commercial Products and Solutions

If the architecture is used as part of a **commercial product or service** where it forms a **core part of the value proposition**,  
then **separate commercial licensing terms must be agreed upon** with the original author.

This includes (but is not limited to):
- SaaS products
- commercial agent platforms
- packaged enterprise solutions
- resold frameworks or AI products

Internal use (even in a company) does **not** fall under this restriction.

---

## 8. Plain English Summary

- The architecture is defined upstream.
- This repo is just an MVP implementation.
- Pay one pizza → you may freely use and develop the architecture for yourself or internally.
- You may publish open-source implementations.
- Published implementations must reference the original architecture and mention the OPL.
- Selling products based on the architecture requires a separate agreement.

🍕 **One Pizza License — open for builders, fair for commerce.**
